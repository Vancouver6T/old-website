Hi everyone,

Happy Groundhog Day

I thought making a website is easy, and it is, but it requires some time to keep up to date and keep content fresh, so I've made a big decision. Since, I'm in my final year of college, I've decided to stop working on this site for a couple months. I'll come back just not soon so that I can graduate. My next post will be after I become a graduate.

That's pretty much it.


Wish me luck!



Have fun!,
