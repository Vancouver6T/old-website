# A decaying ball bounce

It is a bouncing ball that decays over time, like in the real world.<br>
The ball is blue, and the ground is white.

#### Timeline

So first I made a ball and floor.<br>
Then I raised the ball to its apex point.


#### Future

I think I will try to make this using a program, next time.
I think it will go a lot slower, since I haven't learned the blender python3 api.
