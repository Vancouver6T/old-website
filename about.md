# Hello I'm Vancouver6T, v6t for short,

RÃ©sumÃ© is at the top right of the page<br>
Contact info is at the bottom of the page

## Student Info
I'm currently a student at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. <br>
I plan to graduate with a Bachelors of Science during May 2017. 

## Intrests
I currently enjoy Animating and Game making, usually using Blender and Python3 in someway. <br>
Though I also occasionally look into theoretical mathematics, often Set Theory.<br>

### My favorite...
-   place is Melbourne, because I don't like snow, and its awesome there. <br>
-   emoji is :joy:, U+1F602 or, ðŸ˜‚. <br>
-   computer is the Surface Studio from Microsoft, it takes my breath away. <br>
-   (unproven) conjecture is [the generalized continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis#The_generalized_continuum_hypothesis). <br>
-   proven conjecture is [Cantor's Throrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem). <br>
-   axiom is the [Axiom of Infinty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity). <br>

## Outlook on Social Media 
A cool fact about me, is that I'm conscious about what social media accounts I have, so I have a very limited social media outreach. 
In the past, I've had a bad experience with social media, because, it messes with my perception of the world, thru polarization of arguements and and thru people passively supporting without doing more. 
So to help me see not just the two sides, but the spectrum of sides, and to make me not waste anymore time, I keep away. <br>
However, I also watch a lot of YouTube videos in my free time, becasue I think they're fun. 

## Aspirations
One of my dreams is to work at Pixar atleast once, and I'm working on that. <br>
Another of my dreams is to start a YouTube channel, but currently, I don't have time to create content. Once my life settles down more, then I can choose.

I hope you enjoy the blog and learned a little bit about me.
